# Python-Turtle-Grapher
Uses turtle to to iterate over all pixels on the screen, coloring each pixel depending on the output of a function. You can replace this function with anything you like, so basically any curve, area, or shape which can be drawn by algorithmically deciding whether each pixel is on or off, is feasible. Current example loaded in is the mandelbrot set!
